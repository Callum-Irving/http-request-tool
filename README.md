This is a tool for sending HTTP requests. It is meant for testing web APIs.

# TODO
Here's a list of things that need to be fixed:

1. Make HTTP requests asynchronus
2. Handle errors so that the program doesn't crash when users give incorrect inputs
3. Speed up the application in general by optimizing how widgets are rendered

If you know how to do any of these things, please submit a pull request!
